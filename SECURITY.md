# Security Policy

## Supported versions

At the moment, we only officially support the latest version of the project with security updates.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report any vulnerabilities by [opening an issue]({repository-url}/issues/new) and including as many details as you can. We will prioritize security reports above other issues.

We don't currently offer a bounty for OSS vulnerabilities, but if it affects [one of the eligible targets, you might qualify for a reward](https://todoist.com/help/articles/doist-bug-bounty-policy).
