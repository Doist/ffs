# Anatomy of rules

At the heart of FFS are rules. Each feature flag is backed by a rule. It boils down to _functions_ as commonly known in programming, or _formulas_ as commonly seen in spreadsheets. Functions accept data, and return a result. That is numeric, between `0` and `1`.

When it is `0`, the flag is disabled. When `1`, the flag is enabled. When in-between, the flag is partially enabled, meaning it is enabled for some users, proportionally to the value.

## Examples

To build intuition, let's look at some examples:

- `#!js 0`: the flag is disabled.
- `#!js false`: the flag is disabled (same as `0`).
- `#!js 1`: the flag is enabled.
- `#!js true`: the flag is enabled (same as `1`).
- `#!js 0.5`: the flag is enabled for 50% of users.

Let's take it up a notch, and look at more useful rules:

- `#!js gte(now(), datetime("2038-01-19T04:14:07+01:00"))`: enabled after January 19, 2038, at 03:14:07 UTC.
- `#!js matches("*@example.com", env["user.email"])`: enabled for emails ending in `@example.com`.
- `#!js contains(cidr("192.104.36.0/24"), ip(env["user.ip"]))"`: enabled for devices in the 192.104.36.0 â€“ 192.104.36.255 range.
- `#!js map(datetime("2022-11-08"), datetime("2022-11-15"), 0, 1, now())`: gradual rollout between November 8 and November 16, 2022.
- `#!js not(isblank(env["user.email"]))`: enabled for logged-in users (assuming their email is set when logging in).
- `#!js pow(map(datetime("2021-11-08"), datetime("2021-11-15"), 0, 1, now()), 2)`: gradual rollout again, but exponential instead of linear over the week.

## Environment

All metadata supplied by the SDK can be accessed using `env["<key>"]`. You can send _anything_ that makes sense to your app, and then use it in rules.

!!! info

    Noticed `#!js env["user.email"]` in the examples above? It was supplied by the SDK.

## Results

Results are always numerical. `true` and `false` are mapped to `1` and `0`, respectively. Any result that's neither a number nor boolean is treated as `0`.
